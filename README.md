Great battle of human driver against the self driving cars.

What is the current status of the self driving cars?
Can we use them on our public roads? How safe is it?

If not when will this be possible?

The answers to this questiongs should be collected through the competition of the human driver against the machines.

We need to make real great test drive of the best cars though many roads of all the 52 states of the US and compete with different
self driving cars along the way.

We need to make some tests of the self driving cars on the separate areas to check their functionality in complex scenarious.

We need to drive through difficult road conditions like rain, night, fog.

We need to talk to leading experts in this area after that to validate existing solutions on the market and define the current status of the self driving cars industry, make some estimates for the future and support the innovation in this area as much as we can.
